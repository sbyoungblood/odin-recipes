    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>After having dinner one evening at a southern styled restaurant, Avery and I decided we could recreate this particular dish. It worked out great, and we've been enjoying it ever since!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup coarse ground cornmeal</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 ounces sharp cheddar, shredded</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the milk, water, and salt into a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, gradually add the cornmeal while continually whisking. Once all of the cornmeal has been incorporated, decrease the heat to low and cover. Remove lid and whisk frequently, every 3 to 4 minutes, to prevent grits from sticking or forming lumps; make sure to get into corners of pot when whisking. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until mixture is creamy.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, add the pepper and butter, and whisk to combine. Once the butter is melted, gradually whisk in the cheese a little at a time. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
