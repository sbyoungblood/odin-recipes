    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To be completely honest, we have these for dinner <em>far more often</em> than we have then for breakfast, but they are delightful all the same.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds baby red potatoes</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 medium bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cut potatoes into 1 1/2-inch wedges. Place in a large bowl with onion and bell pepper. Add olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; mix well. Place mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn on the broiler and broil until crispy, checking often to prevent burning, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
